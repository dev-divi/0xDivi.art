The Gospel of Love "3" - Reality

# About the Author 

The day before starting this work, a woman was praying for me in a chapel, 
and I opened up a nearby Bible and set my eyes upon these words, 

"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you. 
For behold, days are coming.. when I will restore the fortunes of my people.. and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it." 

# About this Work 

This is a spiritual successor to [The Gospel of Love 2](https://github.com/motibytes/The-Gospel-of-Love-2), 
an artist's interpretation of selected scripture from the Gospel of Matthew. 

The Gospel of Love 2 significantly added to the words of Christ and the Gospel of Matthew and portrayed a fundamentally different portrait of the philosophy of Christ than what is taught in Christology. 

That interpretation captured a portrait of the vision of how the author envisioned the hidden understanding of the poets and lovers. 

The Gospel of Love 3 adds no words to the original gospels, taken directly from the Berean Study Bible. Upon a revelation that the greek 'truth' is indeed synonymous with 'reality, the author understood that the Gospel of Love 2 was incidentally correct in reinterpreting the gospel in terms of awakened consciousness, 
that incidentally the Gospel of Love 2 was "correctly restoring" the gospel to its original meaning. 

Due to the author's own limited consciousness, the Gospel of Love 2 surely could not be taken as a serious 'reinterpretation' of the gospels without expecting it to have its own limited perspectives. 

Upon gaining the awareness that the greek 'truth' translates to 'reality', which is as I might translate it in context to awakening, I know that I can look at the orignal greek and translate the Gospel line by line back into its meaning in terms of Eastern thinking, not in terms of how the West interpreted the meaning of scripture. I know that I can do this without adding anything to the words contained within these translations. 

To explain in plain terms the difference between this translation and modern translations, 
this translation is for the deep. 

Only a fool would take this translation *as gospel*.
# Preface 

John 16:12-13

`I still hold much to tell you, 
but you are not able presently at this moment to carry it. 

However, when the Spirit of Reality comes, he will show you the way into all reality. 


For he will not speak on His own, 
but He will speak as much as He hears,
and He will report to you what is to come.`

* In these verses, truth is reality. 
Jesus says the Spirit of Reality/Truth is coming to you, 
and he will show you the way to All reality, or the Whole reality. 
This word All means Whole, the whole reality, which the Easterners call, 
"As It Is." 
The nature of real truth is that when you see it, you see everything at once, you see the real world for the first time. When you touch truth, you glimpse the ultimate reality underneath all fictional and false realities. 

There is a navigational point in reality from which all reality is revealed to you. 
When truth is made known to you, it can lead you to this centerpoint from which you can view all realities.

This experience is as though you are the center of infinity, 
it is in line with the concept of "You are the Path", 
that you are between many roads and many characters, 
and in reality, you are where you have always been. *
