My Hidden Creative Void 

This year has been one of many victories and blessings that I had been asking for my entire life. 
One of the more negative of my life experiences during this time however, 
had been a certain feeling of detachment, a certain wall or block in which I did not recognize why it seemed that there was nothing there. 
Over time, it began to occur to me that I might be noticing an absence from some of the major changes in my life. 
From childhood, I had been, every day of my existence, saturated in beautiful colors and art from the entire world. My imagination flourished. I sought out the most beautiful movies. I developed a taste for the most intelligent, 
the most brilliant and inventive writing available. Videogames were perhaps more important to my experience of life than the physical world I found myself in.
I could get lost in the worlds of others and I could entertain philosophical dialogue on a level far beyond anyone I was in contact with.

For the first time, I have not been consuming. I have started to observe the wall I have felt, and upon meditating on it, I wonder if it is the version of me 
that would be sitting there, quiet, blank, watching a movie. I am aware that this wall is not even a part of me but simply a conditioned habit that will melt and dissolve
as I stay away from it. It is no understatement of any kind to say that this conditioning is to condition one to be that of not more than an animal. 
Even perhaps an animal might have more cognition than to be reduced to this state of existence. 

I have started to observe that beyond that wall, there is also an emptiness within me. Over time, watching the lives of others I began to see that this emptiness is 
the emptiness of America. I began to see that as a culture, we cover it up with our music and our noise. The deeper the emptiness, the louder the music plays, 
the more hateful the lyrics that come from it, the less consciously aware the individual. 
As I explored it I saw that this darkness over a person is a darkness created from what could almost be considered neglect, or at least disregard, 
of the awareness and caretaking of one's own heart, and deeper. 
It is as though by not looking at the heart with a conscious light, darkness has grown in it. 
However, experientially, this is not concerning the heart as I understand it, 
this darkness is a darkness in one's actual soul. 
This is not to say the common, *dark night of the soul*.
This darkness is a blanket, a covering around the soul to hide what is really inside of the person. 

What is really inside of the person, beyond that darkness around the soul, 
is a true emptiness, not one that has accumulated in the absence of awareness and distraction from pleasure consumption as mentioned before.
This true emptiness is far more cold, striking, stinging, mysterious, hopeless, and of relation to death. 

As I had begun to grow close to this emptiness two things happened. One, others drew near to me as I had gradually become more peaceful and real and self-assured. 
I felt better and my presence was full of bliss and magic. 
The second thing was that I felt potentially isolated or different because I was carrying this emptiness. 

This was before I came to see that this was in no way unique to my experience, 
I started to see that I am inside of a country whose soul is covered in this darkness and I have only just unplugged from the actual matrix. 

Let me explain what is important here. 
The darkness around the soul I describe has been cultivated by lifestyle choices of art consumption in America and will go away.
The emptiness of the soul is a part of humanity and it must be faced and entered into by the living person. 

Our culture recognizes the need for this in a way as we are to bring light to the darkness. 

The result of resting into the emptiness is to become full of infiniteness of being. 
Inside the emptiness all of your infinite self can start to come out in different expressions. 
You will feel powerful and energetic and electric. 

The phenomenon of the darkness and the conditioned animalistic habit of a wall of blankness is this. 
We have falsified imagination. 
We have a borrowed imagination. 
We have imagination on training wheels. 
Our creativity is borrowed. 
Our favorite characters are not our own. 
We deceive ourselves to believe we are creative but we have not drawn from nothingness in so long that 
it may be difficult to even tap into that stream. 
All our information is coming from an outside source and we are convincing ourselves that this is fresh input. 
All the while, the fear of being left alone has been growing in our background. 

I can see now that I filled myself up with outside creativity my entire life. 
If your goal is ever to find yourself, to find out who you are, to self-actualize,
you will need to separate yourself from what you are not. 
You will need to clear the garden out and let something new grow again. 



People do not recognize that they consciously do agree with a bargain in this world. 
The bargain is that it feels good, even to the point of being erotic, to have a master. 
To trust and let go and fall into the arms of one who will control you is to give you complete freedom from all 
of your anxiety and your fear and your worry and your doubt. 
This is the escape that the world is constantly looking for, this is what it truly wants. 
This is the ultimate secret fantasy. 
Man wants to be a slave in order to remove the crushing weight of his failures in his responsibilities. 
To do good feels good, to be praised feels good, to be accepting feels good, 
to have all of this is what man wants most. 

If man's desires are the devil, then what the devil wants most is to let go and disappear. 

Perhaps this is why the modern man rationalizes that life is meaningless, that he is attempting to convince himself 
that if life is meaningless, he can finally let go into this growing desire. 

Man is right now, consumed and living in this desire so totally that it would not actually be a difference if he 
actually became brainwashed to become a sexual slave. He has already taken his thoughts and beliefs from a master 
and he has no independent thought. All that is left is which thoughts are put into his head. 
Man is a perfect and militant machine now, he is a good servant, 
he defends his beliefs with great conviction and reacts with great anger to anything that might disturb them. 

He is so brainwashed right now that the reason why meditation has become such a key in regaining some of an individual's 
being is because the easiest solution to this brainwashing is to get him to stop thinking long enough to recognize that 
his thinking is running like a machine.
