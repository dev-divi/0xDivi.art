Consideration - The Ultimate Meditation 

What would it be like if you focused on how you felt, how you were doing, your own healing and wholeness during every moment of your day? 
What would your day be like if you did not experience the stress of battling a losing struggle over the neverending barrage of thoughts that lead you this way and that? 
What would your experience of life be like if you were not in a perpetual state of wanting what you do not have? 

How attached are you to the current way you experience existing as a person? 
Why? 

The meditation I have been experimenting with is a way to live life outwardly in a way that people have been advising one should operate for centuries. 
Wisdom has always said that it has been reserved, speaking little, yet what little it speaks is of great importance. 
Men know that the words we speak create reality, and ancient scriptures advise that we guard our tongues, not letting one foul word emanate from our being.

Silence is a concept of rest, a hidden concept of readiness and recharging and renewal, the calm before the storm, the sleep to charge the wakening. To find true silence requires either isolation in the real world of nature, or to find one who can direct you to listen to it.

To combine the meditation on silence with opening the mouth to speak of goodness is a way of existing I have been walking on for some time. 
Each day my silence grows deeper and my words grow stronger and I feel better.
