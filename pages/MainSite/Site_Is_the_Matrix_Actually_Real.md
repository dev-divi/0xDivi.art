Is the Matrix Actually Real? 

Yes, the Matrix is actually real. 

When I was growing up, I heard people talk about the matrix, the society, the system, the military industrial complex. 

These people were usually 'depressives' and 'overintelligents' that were not happy with the world's state of affairs. 
In fact, it seemed no one was happy with the world's state of affairs. 

These people who "were out a bit in left field", talking about these words, the system, the matrix,
the machine, this was presented to me as a flair to their language, a flavor of verbage intellectual rebels liked to use 
to describe their negative interpretations of society and its faults, conspiracies, and lies. 

During this time in the early 2000's, our consumer system was now manufacturing culture, trends, fashion, interests, 
and this is what "the matrix" largely referred to, a corporate system of artificiality. 

This is however, not the matrix.

-

A few decades later, the masses had gained the concept of "the matrix", and most have understood it to exist, while not being sure exactly what it is. 

For those in spirituality, it is easy to see the parallel between "the matrix" and the ancient belief in "Gaia's Illusion." 

Gaia's Illusion is the concept that the sensory experience of Earth is a deceptive, alluring multitude of enchantments that draw you into a dreamlike, 
blissful slumber. The one who begins to see through this illusion gains a clear sight when they realize that the trick never changes, 
it is the same in all of its forms and all desires have the same result, 
no matter who offered them or how they were thought about or presented. 

With this concept, the spiritual principle of "Do not be of the world" was taken by the Gnostics not to mean 
"Do not participate in world culture", 
but to mean, "Do not be fooled to believe that the illusion of the world of sensory experience is reality", 
with the understanding that all this world points you to is what exists lurking within your soul. 

Gaia's Illusion may be the simulation we find ourselves in, and the construct of what I call the self-correction system that I will describe in later writings, 
this is the framework of reality, but this is not "the matrix". 

-

The Matrix, the actual Matrix is what the (year) film states clearly, 
"The Matrix is in your mind." 

The matrix is indeed the system but the system is inside of your mind. 

How is this possible? 

The matrix has been programmed into you and reinforced by years of memory and repetition. 

In this world exists a single script that we are all taught to memorize and recite. 
This script is not written by an aware, sane, rational, clear minded being. 

This script has been written by the least alive, least wakeful part of our minds, our limited thoughts, our thoughts that are confusion based. 

The result of following this script is confusion and death, 
and anyone who stands off to the side to observe it can clearly see the march to blood and self-destruction. 

-

The question is, with the Matrix inside our minds and us also speaking from the script, 
how do we stop being a part of it? 

We have to use a different part of our mind to achieve this, a part most of us have not used since we were children, and so like the machine it is, 
it has become rusty and we have forgotten how to use it. 

The mental, the cognitive system in our mind that we use to recite the matrix script is one based on our emotional conditioning. 
What this means is, 
the things you are saying, 
you are saying them because you have feelings about them. 

The reason you react quickly and cannot control your speech is because you are reacting to emotional triggers that you are, 
like a perfect machine, 
responding to. 

-

All beliefs, 
political, logical, religious, 
they are all programmed, conditioned, reinforced into you, 
over, over, and over again. 

When you hear the best argument, the most convincing belief from the best source available, 
you copy it and hold onto it as right. 

This feeling of being right is one of the core feelings you are conditioned with, 
with the same egative conditioning of the belief being the fear of being wrong. 

At this time you have likely heard and seen of all of these things, you have probably glimpsed that 
by not reacting and simply observing yourself, 
you are more likely to not react automatically. 

This is the start, but this alone will not be enough to allow you to regain the dormant part of your mind mentioned before. 

-

To activate what is dormant will take a push of a heavy boulder to get the ball rolling. 

For sake of comfort there is no reason to push this boulder. Reacting to reality and reciting the script of the matrix is much suffering and turmoil, 
but it is dramlike and it continues on its own, we continue dancing with it. 

-

Let me tell you a secret. 
You, we, we're always dancing. 
You can never stop dancing, not as long as you live. 
Dancing is effortless because you are an object in motion staying in motion. 
The only thing that requires any effort in existence is in 
changing the direction in which you dance. 

-

Although you can easily continue living the script of the matrix, 
the matrix's script is a dance of great strife and an experience of great difficulty, 
of stresses and diseases that will kill you. Although this ignorance is easy because it requires no change, 
it is hard because it is unlivable and you are dancing in a way that is pulling away from your very soul, 
which will be discussed in later writings as resisting the system of self-correction we are existing in. 

-

The solution I am aware of is in regaining or learning for the first time how to activate the faculties of critical thinking within.
This is by accessing reality in all its data, in all your thoughts, in all your world with a pair of fresh eyes, 
from the eyes of a newborn child. 

The way out of the matrix is to stop believing your beliefs and let them go in favor of deciding again for the first time what is real to you. 

- 

The method I present to achieve this is this, 
try something new, 
do something unexpected, 
say what you would not normally say, 
take risks, 
forfeit your fear of outcomes of embarassment or shame. 

This is the last moment of your life. 
This is the last moment of your life. 
This is the last moment of your life. 

- Creative Approach Part 1 

Take a creative approach to your environment, 
even perhaps your thoughts. 

You cannot creatively do worse or more harm than by continuing to act out of the script of the matrix. 
No matter what you do, it cannot be as bad as that. 

A favorite perspective of mine I entertain often, almost every day. 
Imagine that in this moment, all of these people around you like planets in solar orbit 
and they will never again be positioned like this ever again as they are, never again for all eternity. 

Imagine that if you were to look at your life like a book,
then if you were to automatically participate in your life as you normally would have,
then you, right now, just by imagining that, 
you have already seen that pathway, it is in your past. 

Imagine that not only will this moment in an instant be gone forever but also you have the opportunity to 
participate differently this time, in this second chance. 

I often fantasize even that perhaps I am making a new decision from not only this life but also in patterns I had repeated in lives long past and long forgotten. 

To make a creative action is not because you need to, or that you ought to to avoid the drastic consequences, 
but to have fun. 

To try something new, to be curious of a different possibility, these interests and motivations activate those greater mental faculties that you have been conditioned not to use. 

- Creative Approach Part 2 

You are a fully creative beig with an opportunity to change anything in the script. 

The script has lied to you and told you that if you take a risk you might do something wrong. 
This is not the case. You **are** doing something wrong if you follow the script. 

All creative actions you take are good because you took a chance on yourself, 
which proves your own worthiness, 
which provides the opportunity for others to take a chance on themselves. 

Even in your complete failure you give others more permission to take a risk for themselves. 

Creative actions create life, and even destructive creative actions result in less death than the actual death of the matrix. 

The secret of the matrix is not that it leads to death, for this anyone can see. 
The secret is that the matrix is death, it is dead. 
The matrix was never alive. 
It responds to triggers upon triggers upon triggers, 
it is a very lifelike program, 
there is no conscious activity to it. 
It has an intelligence built up of nested and layered triggers, 
but there is no conscious entity inside its mind. 

Consciousness is a required element to constitute life and without it, life withers. 
Life actually exists within consciousness, but nothing can exist outside of that. 
The script of the matrix only exists because we have the creative power to perpetuate anything we desire, 
and from our limited perspective of mind, we are perpetuating the system of the matrix. 

When we stop giving trees our attention, the trees are fine, the trees are a part of consciousness. 
When we stop giving the matrix our attention, the matrix disappears, because it never existed.

-

When you consciously intend to choose to do it differently this time, 
you will always make a better choice because you are not who you were and also because consciously in the present moment, 
you are who you really are. 
    For example, before you felt tired and reacted negatively to someone. 
    Now you've decided not to be that way this time. 
    Why? Because the real you right now in the present always wants goodness, justice, peace, and all things of this nature. 

As there are too many concepts here to take all of them with you in one sitting, I encourage you to consider one to three of them or research them further in your days ahead.
