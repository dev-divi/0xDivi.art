# Why We Are Not Yet Living in the Flow State 

Right now, some of the modern world and business world has recognized the value of the flow state, 
the optimal state of a human being. 

I say this truly, they are not yet thinking about flow the way you can be. 

They have seen the flow state in a container and have attempted to identify the triggers in that container to invoke the state on command. 

This artificial technique they are developing is the hard way, and this is because they are thinking about this the wrong way. 

This is often the case for those who believe that we are in the future now, and are not looking into the past, they do not believe that the past had already discovered what they are yet to discover. 

Their world is the world of achievement and performance. Their goals are to set and break records, create metrics, perform feats in the eyes of others. Their activities are extreme sports, their goals are largely physical or technological. 

They have seen the flow state activated in surfing, in flying in space, they have identified that these activities cause it. They find it in activities. They find it at the peak of excellence. 

Activities, especially activities in the flow state, are amazing, but I do not believe they are enough to live a fulfilling life. One often has to go to great struggle and length to get to an activity, and not all activities are always going to be available to everyone. 

What if I told you that the flow state is not dependent on these activities? 
What if I told you that flow is more than a state of being? 

Researchers have looked to see that gratitude helps facilitate the flow state, that the cultivation of gratitude makes it easier to access the flow state. 

I want to tell you why that is. 

This is because there is a way to think in flow. 
Flow has to do not with what we do, but how we think. 
Flow was figured out long ago and it has been called by many names, 
the most recent name for flow has been the mysterious word, consciousness. 
Consciousness has been a difficult word in modern times because it has been used as a placeholder term for existence, 
and also used to point to more, but what it points to is impossible to point to. 

People describe this consciousness pure consciousness, pure form, pure essence, and describe it as an ocean, a river, a flowing river. 
We say that most people are on the side of the river, sometimes they go to drink from it, in this activity or that. 

The flowing river and the flow state are the same. The flow state is not a state caused by an activity. 
THe activity is reality and the person has reencountered reality. 

There is a "correct way to think", and that way to think is thinking in a flowing way. 
The world is not currently thinking in this flowing way, because in a way, 
you have to see the river, you have to know how to swim in order to go with it. 

You will still always be near the river, you will still always happen upon it, you will still dive into it if you go into an extreme activity, but you can't stay in it because your thinking mind is not operating quite as it was designed to be thinking. 

This may be why buddha had a concept known as "right thought" or "right mind". 

It is possible to live in flow, without doing anything, to live every moment in the pure bliss that is flow. 

One of the keys science has found about the nature of the flow state is that when you are in it, your thoughts disappear and you are engaged with your activity totally. 
This is the effect they are causing, 
but this is the art that can be mastered, the art of engaging with life totally and causing unnecessary thoughts to disappear. 

This is not just possible, this is what life has always been about. 
I believe that even the animals and the birds are in flow, right now. 
I believe that even you are in flow, right now. 

As I said they say about consciousness, people say that consciousness is like the ocean, if you are a fish you cannot see it, but the water of it is all around you. There is no greater analogy because consciousness does feel like the thick fluidity of water when you see it. Even your mind and thoughts can be drowned into flowing water if you find it. This is why flow feels like it is flowing, because it is this ocean of consciousness I am talking about. 

We are not entering only a chemically induced altered state as science believes, we are reentering reality and ourselves. Reality is pure flowing form and it always has been, always will be and we were always meant to live in it. 

Flow is natural and naturally occurring, and to access it all we have to do is learn how to think naturally. 
This is to say, we have to unlearn how we were conditioned to thinking and return, to remember how to think for ourselves for the first time. 

Pursue the art of flow.
